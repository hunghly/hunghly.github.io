    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Here's the Hope you've been looking for! The Gift of Eternal Life!
      1. Realize that you are a sinner. Romans 3:23 - 'For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.'
      2. Realize that you need to be forgiven of your sins. Romans 6:23 - 'For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.'
      3. Realize that Jesus loves you and wants to forgive you. Romans 10:13 - 'For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Jesus, have mercy unto me a sinner. Come into my heart and forgive me of my sins. I claim You as my Savior and I place my trust solely on You. Amen.
      Just saying this prayer alone won't save you, but putting your faith in Jesus and believing He will answer the prayer will. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:10 (KJV)
